            If there are places associated with a confirmed COVID-19 case in the past 14 days, they will be listed on the map above. Locations are generally removed 14 days after the last known date that a confirmed case was associated with the location.

            In Greater Sydney (including the Blue Mountains, Central Coast, Wollongong and Shellharbour), the exposure locations map lists close contact venues that are assessed as a public health risk. Outside of Greater Sydney, the exposure locations map lists close and casual contact venues. Read more about the map.

            Case location times are listed in the local time zone. For example, venues in Broken Hill are listed in Central Standard Time (CST).
