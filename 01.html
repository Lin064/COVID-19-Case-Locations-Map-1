				<h2>Shopping centre joins jab service<small>September 2, 2021</small></h2>
				<p>The Government's outreach team today set up a temporary vaccination area at Lok Fu Place to provide a walk-in BioNTech vaccination service to tenants and the public.</p>
				<p>This marks the second COVID-19 outreach vaccination event held at a shopping centre, following the one at a Kwun Tong shopping mall in early August.</p>
				<p>Secretary for the Civil Service Patrick Nip inspected the administering of the vaccine there, saying that such an arrangement will assist people who want to get vaccinated to do so immediately and facilitate the elderly and residents nearby.</p>
				<p>It can also draw other people's attention to the importance and urgency of getting vaccinated when they walk by the vaccination area, he added.</p>
				<p>Noting that the COVID-19 Vaccination Programme has been in place for more than six months with the outreach vaccination service initially provided to mainly enterprises, Mr Nip said it is time to move the focus to the district level to enable more people to receive jabs by using various methods.</p>
